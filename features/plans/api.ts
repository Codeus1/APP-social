/**
 * Plans API — now handled entirely by tRPC.
 *
 * The tRPC client (lib/trpc/client.ts) and React hooks (features/plans/hooks.ts)
 * replace the previous HTTP-based fetch functions.
 *
 * This file is kept as a placeholder. If you need imperative (non-hook) access
 * to the tRPC client in the future, you can set up a vanilla tRPC client here.
